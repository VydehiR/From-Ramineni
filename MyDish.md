# Vydehi Ramineni

 My favourite food is Pani Puri. Panipuri offers a unique combination of spicy, tangy, sweet, and savory flavors. The puris are filled with a mixture of tamarind water, chickpeas, potatoes, and spices, creating an explosion of taste with each bite.The puris are crisp and hollow, providing a satisfying crunch. This texture contrasts beautifully with the soft, flavorful fillings and the liquid tamarind water.
